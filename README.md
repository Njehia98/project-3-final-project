# project-3-final-project
This is a Command Line Delivery Application where a customer gives his or her details i.e Name, Age, Contact and Address and gives a rating with an optional comment. The application includes Python ORM methods i.e create, delete, search, copy, display. There is one-to-many relationship between customer.py and address.py and review.py. 
I have a database created using psql to store and manage my customer's data.
The application is interactive and stimulates user participation. Instructions, and a menu will be displayed. The menu is really straightforward and self-explanatory. Each instruction from the menu will provide a response on the same command line interface, depending on whether data is returned from the instruction or an error occurs during its execution. The application can also be exited by following the straightforward menu instruction.
